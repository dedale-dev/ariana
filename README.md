Ariana is an IDE extension and CLI tool to understand what your JS, TS and Python code does when it runs in development way faster than with a traditional debugger or with `print()` or `console.log()`.

## ✨ Key Features

Just by running your code with the `ariana` CLI and by using the Ariana VSCode extension, you can:
- 🕵️ Inspect the **last values taken by any expression** in your code just by hovering it.
- ⏱️ See **how long** it took for any expression in your code to run.
- 🧵 *Feed traces* ***to Copilot/Cursor*** *via MCP so they can know everything that happened when your code ran.* (soon) 

## 📖 How to use

#### 1) 💾 Install the `ariana` CLI

With npm:

```bash
npm install -g ariana
```

With pip:

```bash
pip install ariana
```

#### 2) ✨ Run supported code as you would from the command line but with the `ariana` command along side it

```bash
ariana <run command>
```

For example, on a JS/TS codebase it could be:

```bash
ariana npm run dev
```

... and on a Python codebase it could be:

```bash
ariana python myscript.py --some-options-maybe
```

#### 3) 👾 In your IDE, get instant debugging information in your code files.

You can install the extension on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dedale-dev.ariana), or by searching for `Ariana` in the extensions tab in VSCode or Cursor.

- Open a code file, press `ctrl + shift + p` and search for the `Ariana: Toggle Traced Expressions Highlighting` command.
- 🗺️ Know which code segments got ran and which didn't
- 🕵️ Inspect the values that were taken by any expression in your code

*Optional: If you just want to try out Ariana on example piece of code before using it on your own code, you can do this:*

```
git clone https://github.com/dedale-dev/node-hello.git
cd node-hello
npm i
ariana npm run start
```

## Code processing disclaimer

We need to process **(but never store!)** your JS/TS code files on our server based in EU in order to have Ariana work with it. It is not sent to any third-party including any LLM provider. An enterprise plan will come later with enterprise-grade security and compliance. If that is important to you, [please let us know](https://discord.gg/Y3TFTmE89g).

## Licence

Ariana is released under AGPLv3. See [LICENCE.txt](LICENCE.txt) for more details.

tl;dr: If you use Ariana as intended, which means in development, this is nothing to worry about as you don't technically bundle Ariana with your released code. If you use it in your production code, whether deployed on a server or on the end-user's machine in a code or binary format, your code needs to be available to the public under the same licence. We can lift that requirement upon request, even for free if your project is small. Please [let us know](mailto:an.nougaret@gmail.com).
