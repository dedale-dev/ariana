Ariana is an IDE extension and CLI tool to understand what your JS, TS and Python code does when it runs in development way faster than with a traditional debugger or with `print()` or `console.log()`.

## ✨ Key Features

Just by running your code with the `ariana` CLI and by using the Ariana VSCode extension, you can:
- 🕵️ Inspect the **last values taken by any expression** in your code just by hovering it.
- ⏱️ See **how long** it took for any expression in your code to run.
- 🧵 *Feed traces* ***to Copilot/Cursor*** *via MCP so they can know everything that happened when your code ran.* (soon) 

## 📖 How to use

#### 1) 💾 Install the `ariana` CLI

With npm:

```bash
npm install -g ariana
```

With pip:

```bash
pip install ariana
```

#### 2) ✨ Run supported code as you would from the command line but with the `ariana` command along side it

```bash
ariana <run command>
```

For example, on a JS/TS codebase it could be:

```bash
ariana npm run dev
```

... and on a Python codebase it could be:

```bash
ariana python myscript.py --some-options-maybe
```

#### 3) 👾 In your IDE, get instant debugging information in your code files.

You can install the extension on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dedale-dev.ariana), or by searching for `Ariana` in the extensions tab in VSCode or Cursor.

- Open a code file, press `ctrl + shift + p` and search for the `Ariana: Toggle Traced Expressions Highlighting` command.
- 🗺️ Know which code segments got ran and which didn't
- 🕵️ Inspect the values that were taken by any expression in your code

*Optional: If you just want to try out Ariana on example piece of code before using it on your own code, you can do this:*

```
git clone https://github.com/dedale-dev/node-hello.git
cd node-hello
npm i
ariana npm run start
```

## Code processing disclaimer

We need to process (but never store!) your JS/TS code files on our server based in EU in order to have Ariana work with it. It is not sent to any third-party including any LLM provider. An enterprise plan will come later with enterprise-grade security and compliance. If that is important to you, [please let us know](https://discord.gg/Y3TFTmE89g).
